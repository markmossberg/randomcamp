# Randomcamp

The concept behind this project is to make a simple tool that allows people
to easily find new music through going to random Bandcamp pages. It doesn't quite accomplish the "random" part, but it tries really hard to fake it. 

In the future it would be cool to convert this from a script to a web app.
